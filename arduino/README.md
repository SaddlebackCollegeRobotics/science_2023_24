SCR 2023-24's science system.

FOR TEMPERATURE SENSOR:
Make sure you get the OneWire and DallasTemperature library :D

FOR CARBON DIOXIDE SENSOR: 
Ya need Adafruit SCD30
AND Adafruit Unified Sensor~

FOR MOISTURE SENSOR: Impossible to detect % of moisture with this sensor, read the comments for an interpretation of values

FOR MOTOR CONTROLLER:
You can change the step size and the speed but I think the one I have right now is pretty good
